# Lab Material & Code

This folder contains the code that I wrote for each of the labs in the course. The labs primarily focused on developing a deeper understanding of the mathematical ideas of convolution, Fourier transformations and time-frequency techniques on various types of data (simulated signals or actual time-series data). Filter design techniques by means of Z-transforms and investigating pole-zero plots were a prominant part of the labs as well. All labs were pre-requisite exploratory modules in order to develop techniques relevant to the major assignment.
